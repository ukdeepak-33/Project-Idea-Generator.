Project Idea Generator

The Problem: It's tough to come up with a fresh, original idea for a personal project or startup. People often get stuck at the very beginning.

Core Functionality (MVP): A simple web page where a user enters their interests or a general problem they want to solve. The application uses a powerful language model to generate a list of unique, detailed project ideas with a name, a brief description, and a list of key features.

How I Can Help: I can provide the complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for a single-file web application that you can open directly in your browser. It will include all the logic to take user input, make an API call to a language model, and display the generated ideas beautifully on the page.
